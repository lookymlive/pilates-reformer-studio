# System Patterns

## System architecture

Based on the file structure (`index.html`, `src/`, `components.json`, `tailwind.config.js`, `vite.config.ts`, `package.json`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`), this project appears to be a modern web application, likely a Single Page Application (SPA), built with a JavaScript/TypeScript framework (possibly React, Vue, or Angular, given `src/` and `vite.config.ts`), using Tailwind CSS for styling, and managed by `pnpm`.

## Key technical decisions

- **Frontend Framework**: To be determined, but likely a component-based framework.
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling.
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized builds.
- **Package Manager**: pnpm for efficient dependency management.

## Design patterns in use

- **Component-based architecture**: Implied by the `src/` and `components.json`.
- **Modular design**: Breaking down the application into smaller, manageable units.

## Component relationships

- Components will likely interact through props and state management, typical of modern frontend frameworks.
