# Active Context

## Current work focus

The current focus is on implementing 10 incremental improvements to the application and committing them to Git with clear, descriptive messages.

## Recent changes

No recent changes have been made yet, as we are in the initial phase of planning the improvements.

## Next steps

1. Understand the current codebase and identify areas for improvement.
2. Discuss potential improvements with the user to align on priorities.
3. Develop a detailed plan for the 10 commits.
4. Execute the plan, making incremental changes and committing them.

## Active decisions and considerations

- The specific nature of the 10 improvements needs to be defined.
- How to best break down larger improvements into smaller, logical commits.
