# Progress

## What works

- The initial project structure is set up.
- Basic dependencies are likely installed (indicated by `pnpm-lock.yaml`).
- **Calendar View Implementation:**
    - Supabase database schema for schedules, classes, profiles, and student_classes is defined.
    - `react-big-calendar` is integrated.
    - Dynamic schedule data is fetched from Supabase and displayed.
    - Event display is customized with relevant information and styling.
    - Calendar view toggles (Day, Week, Month) and navigation are functional.
    - Role-Based Filtering with RLS in Supabase is integrated (ensuring data privacy).
    - Form for adding new schedule items (UI only) is implemented.
    - API integration for schedule creation is complete, including fetching dynamic dropdown data.
    - Realtime updates are implemented for schedules and student assignments, providing instant calendar synchronization.
    - Improved loading and error states for the calendar view.

## What's left to build

- 10 incremental improvements to the application.
- Specific features or bug fixes are yet to be identified and implemented.
- Further refinements based on user feedback.
- Advanced features like editing/deleting schedules, recurring events, drag-and-drop functionality.
- More comprehensive error handling and user notifications.
- Filtering options for calendar view (by teacher, student, class type).
- User authentication flow and profile management (beyond basic RLS).

## Current status

- The project is in the initial setup phase for defining improvements.
- Memory Bank files are being created to establish context.
- The core calendar functionality for viewing and adding schedules is complete and robust, with real-time updates and basic role-based data filtering.
- All 10 planned commits for the calendar feature have been implemented.

## Known issues

- No known issues yet, as no functional changes have been made.
- No known critical issues.
- The `ScheduleForm` currently only supports adding a single student to a private class; group classes with multiple student assignments via the form are not yet fully implemented (though the DB schema supports it).
- No editing or deletion functionality for schedules is implemented via the UI yet.
